### About Project & Features

- This is an Asp.Net Core Api project. There are 2 APIs in this case. First API is for authentication [UserLogin], second API gets data from Reddit [RedditJsonGet]. 

Main features of the application:

- Users can be authenticated in the application by providing their username and password as json format in the request body.
- After authentication, the application sends jwt token to users and marks them as authenticated.
- Only authenticated users can access data got from the public service by sending get requests to the Reddit url by adding query parameters as keyword.

### First API [UserLogin]

- First API creates JWT token if User logins succesfully. There is no database in this project. Users' datas are in [UserService]. So there is a [User] entity in Entities and a [LoginModel] model in Models.
- There is a class for JWT setting [JwtSettings] and settings values can be found in [appsettings].
- [JwtHelper] has a method which creates tokens. This method is used in the controller if Login is successful.

### Second API [RedditJsonGet]

- Second API gets data from public service. The url which belongs to Reddit can be found in the api's controller [RedditController]. 
- If authorization is granted with token, json deserialization will be done and datas will return.   
- In the controller, Get() method expects a string parameter. This value is required for [subreddit].
- Json data is specialized as below.

Example:
```json
{
"subreddit": "rome",
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "The baths of Caracalla are a gem",
            "url": "https://imgur.com/a/cdYFZZv",
            "author_fullname": "t2_7fl3m"
        },
    ]
     "numberOfImages": 1
}
```
